# Instructions and Guidance for Instructors

## General

- Try and run the commands along with participants as well (if your presentation allows)
- Each session try to remind and check people have loaded the corresponding conda environment AT THE BEGINNING of the session
- All work should occur in the `/vol/volume/<your_session>`

### Set Up

- We recommend using two screens, one for gather.town, one for slides
- If using Firefox: share _window_ (not screen)
  - Sharing whole screen appears to result in shearing (not the whole image updates) when changing slides

### Gather.Town

- In the _lecture theatre_ use the pedestal to speak from. Tell attendees to use the podium on the right hand side to ask questions (you will not be able to hear the rest of the room)
  - Alternatively: if you send your gather.town account (if you want) to James, he will give you admin rights which includes the possibility to 'spotlight' people in the room by clicking on their face in the partipcpants menu
- Promote the use of and monitor of the reaction emojis to ask questions (if you wish)
- If doing tech support/TA:
  - Use the 'grey' space at the bottom of workshop room 1/other workshop room/corridor to isolate yourself and the person requesting help from the rest of the room, or use bubbles
  - To set up the bubble: double click on the presons avatar. To close the bubble move away from the person
  - Make sure to share your screen AFTER setting up the bubble, and stop sharing BEFORE moving away

## At EVA

- Use ABI Seminar room for main presenter
  - TA can either use balcony
