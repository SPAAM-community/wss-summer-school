# Day Five

## Lecture 5A: Evolutionary Biology

**Instructors**: Sebastian Duchene

**Abstract**: Pathogen genome data are an invaluable source of information about the evolution and spread of these organisms. This talk will focus on molecular phylogenetic methods and the insight that they can reveal from improving our understanding of ancient evolution to the epidemiological dynamics of current outbreaks.

The first section will introduce phylognenetic trees and a set of core terms and concepts for their interpretation. Next, it will focus on some of the most popular approaches to inferring phylogenetic trees; those based on genetic distance, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. These methods carry important considerations regarding the process that generated the data, computational capability, and data quality, all of which will be discussed here. Finally, we will direct our attention to examples of analyses of ancient and modern pathogens (e.g. Yersinia pestis, Hepatitis B virus, SARS-CoV-2) and critically assess appropriate choice of models and methods.

## Practical 5B: Phylogenomics

**Instructors**: Aida Andrades Valtueña and Arthur Kocher

**Abstract**: Phylogenetic trees are central tools for studying the evolution of microorganisms, as they provide essential information about their relationships and timing of divergence between microbial strains.

In this session, we will introduce basic phylogenetic concepts and definitions, and provide guidance on how to interpret phylogenetic trees. We will then learn how to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from DNA sequences using various methods ranging from distance-based methods to probabilistic approaches, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics. In particular, we will learn how to use ancient genomic data to reconstruct time-calibrated trees with BEAST2.

## Practical 5C: Functional Genomics

**Instructors**: Irina Velsko and James Fellows Yates

**Abstract**: The value of microbial taxonomy lies in the implied biochemical properties of a given taxon. Historically taxonomy was determined by growth characteristics and cell properties, and more recently through genomic and genetic similarity. The genomic content of microbial taxa, specifically the presence or absence of genes, determine how those taxa interact with their environment, including all the biochemical processes they participate in, both internally and externally. Strains within any microbial species may have different genetic content and therefore may behave strikingly differently in the same environment, which cannot be determined through taxonomic profiling. Functionally profiling a microbial community, or determining all of the genes present independent of the species they are derived from, reveals the biochemical reactions and metabolic products the community may perform and produce, respectively. This approach may provide insights to community activity and environmental interactions that are hidden when using taxonomic approaches alone. In this session we will perform functional profiling of metagenomic communities to assess their genetic content and inferred metabolic pathways.
