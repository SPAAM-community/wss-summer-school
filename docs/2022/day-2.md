# Day Two

## Day Overview

### Lecture 2A: Introduction to ancient DNA

**Instructors**: Christina Warinner

**Abstract**: TBC

### Practical 2B: Introduction to Git(Hub)

**Instructors**: Megan Michel

**Abstract**: As the size and complexity of metagenomic analyses continues to expand, effectively organizing and tracking changes to scripts, code, and even data, continues to be a critical part of ancient metagenomic analyses. Furthermore, this complexity is leading to ever more collaborative projects, with input from multiple researchers.

In this practical session, we will introduce 'Git', an extremely popular version control system used in bioinformatics and software development to store, track changes, and collaborate on scripts and code. We will also introduce, GitHub, a cloud-based service for Git repositories for sharing data and code, and where many bioinformatic tools are stored. We will learn how to access and navigate course materials stored on GitHub through the web interface as well as the command line, and we will create our own repositories to store and share the output of upcoming sessions.

### Practical 2C: Introduction to AncientMetagenomeDir

**Instructors**: James Fellows Yates

**Abstract**: Finding relevent comparative data for your ancient metagenomic analysis is not trivial. While palaeogenomicists are very good at uploading their raw sequencing data to large sequencing data repositories such as the EBI's ENA or NCBI's SRA archives in standardised file formats, these files often have limited metadata. This often makes it difficult for researchers to search for and download relevent published data they wish to use use to augment their own analysis.

AncientMetagenomeDir is a community project from the SPAAM community to make ancient metagenomic data more accessible. We curate a list of standardised metadata of all published ancient metagenomic samples and libraries, hosted on GitHub. In this session we will go through how to use the AncientMetagenomeDir repository and associated tools to find and download data for your own analyses. We will also discuss important things to consider when publishing your own data to make it more accessible for other researchers.

### Practical 2D: Introduction to nf-core/eager

**Instructors**: Megan Michel and James Fellows Yates

**Abstract**: TBC

### Roundtable: Project organisation

**Chairs**: TBC

We will discuss the various ways how to structure analysis folders for your research in a manner that promotes portability and reproducibility. Participants can ask for advice and suggestions from the instructors for their specific research projects.
