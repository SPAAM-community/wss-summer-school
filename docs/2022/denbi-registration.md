# Registration for deNBI Cloud

For the 2022 edition of the summer school, we will be using cloud computing nodes kindly provided by the German [deNBI infrastructure](https://www.denbi.de/cloud).

For the use of the computing nodes you will need to sign up for the services. As deNBI is supported by European-wide biology and bioinformatics infrastructure, this requires a multi-step process.

This can be summarised as follows:

- Registration with Life Sciences Research Infrastructure login system
- Registration with the ELIXIR bioinformatics infrastructure
- Registration with deNBI and the SPAAM Summer School deNBI group.

The procedure may seem a little convoluted at first, so we provide detailed instructions below.

Note you can only proceed with the instructions after recieveing an email from the Summer School organisers containing the registration link.

## Registration on Life Sciences Research Infrastructure

Once you open the link from the email sent by the organisers, you will first be sent to the LifeSciencesRI page.

Here you will have multiple options on how to register, such as via ORCID or Google centralised log-in providers.

We generally recommend ORCID as a common system used across many academic services (such as journals), and is a good way to keep track of your academic record.

If you do not want to connect any of your other accounts to the your LifeSciencesRI account, you can just register directly with the 'Log in with LS username' option at the bottom.

In this example we will use the ORCID service. Once you press the ORCID button, you will be asked to log in with your ORCID credentials.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/2-lifescienceri_example_orcid_identity_provider.png">

Then you will be asked to authorize that the LifeSciencesRI account can pull some information from your ORCID profile.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/3-lifescienceri_example_orcird_authorise.png">

Once you've consented to linking of the accounts, you will be asked to specify your preferred name, email address and username for the LifeSciencesRI account.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/4-lifescienceri_specify_login_info.png">

Once you submit, you will be sent a verification email.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/5-lifescienceri_emailverification.png">

This should come within a few minutes, and make sure to check your spam folder. The email should like as follows:

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/6-lifescienceri_emailconfirmationemail.png">

Once you click the link, you'll be sent back to the LifesciencesRI page, where you need to login with your preferred provider to continue the next steps.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/7-lifescienceri_postconfirmation_login.png">

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="70%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/8-lifescienceri_postconfirmation_login_orcid.png">

You will then see a confirmation that your emailed has been verified. Do not close this tab! Press the `Continue` button and continue with this walkthrough

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/9-lifescienceri_emailverificationsuccess.png">

You will now be redirected to the next registration step.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/10-lifescienceri_redirecttoelixirregistration.png">

Note in the meantime you will also have recieved an email confirmation of the new LifeSciencesRI account which will look like

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/7a-lifescienceri_success_email_confirmation.png">

## Registration for ELIXIR

Once the LifeSciencesRI registration is complete, we will now use the LifeSciencesRI account to subscribe to the ELIXIR bioinformatics network.

After being re-directed, you'll be asked to confirm or fill in the username/email address for the ELIXIR servce. In most cases this will be taken directly from the LifeSciences RI.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/11-elixir_membership_application.png">

Once submitted you should see a confirmation window. Press `Continue` and do not close this tab! You'll be redirected to the next step of the registration process.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/12-elixir_membership_success.png">

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/13-elixir_post_membership_success_redirect.png">

And you should have recieved in the meantime a confirmation email.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/12a-elixir_success_email_confirmation.png">

## Registration for deNBI and the SPAAM Summer School 2022

You now should have been redirected to the final stage of the registration process: setting up your deNBI cloud account and the SPAAM Summer School specific deNBI project group.

This procedure is similar to that for ELIXIR.

On the page you were redirected to, either confirm or fill in the required email/username, and read and accept the usage policy. Press submit.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/14-denbi_org_registration.png">

On the next page, it will ask you to confirmation registration for the SPAAM Summer Shool specific deNBI project. Fill in and press Submit.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/15-denbi_workshop_registration.png">

You will now be asked to verify your email address for the deNBI membership.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/16-denbi_org_membership_confirmation.png">

The email should look something like the following. Again, check your spam folder if you do not recieve an email. Make sure to press the link in the email.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/17-denbi_workshop_verify_email_email.png">

You should then get a page confirming the registration to deNBI. You can now close this tab.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/18-denbi_workshop_email_verification_success.png">

## Confirming everything all worked

You will now have to wait for approval to join the workshop nodes by the SPAAM Summer School organisers. Expect this to take between an hour and a couple of days.

However in the meantime we can also check we can correct access the deNBI cloud services by going to their [homepage](https://cloud.denbi.de), and press 'Log In'

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/19-denbicloud_final_verification_login.png">

Select your login provider as peformed above, and this time you will be asked to consent for deNBI to access your ELXLIR information.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/20-denbicloud_login_lifescienceri_consent_1.png">

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/20-denbicloud_login_lifescienceri_consent_2.png">

We recommend selecting 'forever' for convienence, but this is not required.

You should now recieve another email where you must confirm the consent.

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/20a_denbicloud_lifescienceri_consent_email_confirmation.png">

## Finish

In total, you can expect to have recieved the following emails

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="75%" src="/assets/images/2022/denbi_registration/23-email_overview.png">

With this, you should be all set up to go. You will recieve further instructions from the organisers how to access your personal computing nodes via email before the summer school.
