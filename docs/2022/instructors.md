ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **James Fellows Yates** is an archaeology-trained biomolecular archaeologist and convert to palaeogenomics, and recently pivoting to bioinformatics. He specialises in ancient metagenomics analysis, generating tools and high-throughput approaches for validating and analysis of ancient oral microbiomes and palaeogenomic data in general.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **Christina Warinner** is Group Leader of Microbiome Sciences at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and Associate Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University. She serves on the Leadership Team of the Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean (MHAAM), and is a Professor in the Faculty of Biological Sciences at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her research focuses on the use of metagenomics and paleoproteomics to better understand past human diet, health, and the evolution of the human microbiome.

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **Aida Andrades ValtueÃ±a** is a geneticist interested in pathogen evolution, with particular interest in prehistoric pathogens. She has been exploring new methods to analyse ancient pathogen data to understand their past function and ecology to inform models of pathogen emergence.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Alex HÃ¼bner** is a computational biologist, who originally studied biotechnology, before switching to evolutionary biology during his PhD. For his postdoc in the Warinner lab, he focuses on investigating whether new methods in the field of modern metagenomics can be directly applied to ancient DNA data. Here, he is particularly interested in the _de novo_ assembly of ancient metagenomic sequencing data and the subsequent analysis of its results.

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· **Thiseas Lamnidis** is a human population geneticist interested in European population history after the Bronze Age. To gain the required resolution to differentiate between Iron Age European populations, he is developing analytical methods based on the sharing of rare variation between individuals. He has also contributed to pipelines that streamline the processing and analysis of genetic data in a reproducible manner, while also facilitating dissemination of information among interdisciplinary colleagues.

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **Arthur Kocher** initially trained as a veterinarian. He then pursued a PhD in the field of disease ecology, during which he studied the impact of biodiversity changes on the transmission of zoonotic diseases using molecular tools such as DNA metabarcoding. During his Post-Docs, he extended his research focus to evolutionary aspects of pathogens, which he currently investigates using ancient genomic data and Bayesian phylogenetics.
