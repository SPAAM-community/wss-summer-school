# Registration for deNBI Cloud

For the 2024 edition of the summer school, we will again be using cloud computing nodes kindly provided by the German [deNBI infrastructure](https://www.denbi.de/cloud).

For the use of the computing nodes you will need to sign up for the services.

You will need to start the process from the following registration link here [here](https://simplevm.denbi.de/portal/webapp/#/workshops/invitation/10927e3ca3f5463d9718363c01a9a4e0), and if anything is unclear, follow the instructions in walkthrough from deNBI is available here: [https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/registration/](https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/registration/).

The final step of the registration process will be to send your registration to the SimpleVM SPAAMSumScho2024 workshop. Make sure to continue the process until you get to this point!

Note that the starting link will only be active from the once acceptance emails have been sent out.

The process will take you through:

1. Selecting an identity provider of an existing account (e.g. institutional account, ORCiD, Google)

   > ℹ️ If your institution does not come up in the 'Login with' search box, we highly recommend instead using your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) if you have one (and if not, get one!), as this is extremely useful for aggregating all of your academic output (and is used by _many_ academic services nowadays such as publishers).

2. Registering/linking this account with LifeSciencesRI/Login (this is a centralised EU level single-sign-on service for EU biology related infrastructure)

   > ⚠ Please be aware that there may be _multiple_ confirmation emails (up to a maximum of three) sent to your email inbox and you will need to confirm them all! This is due to European data privacy laws.

   > ℹ️ If via the Institutional route you get a 'No user account found' error, press 'Proceed to register for an account'

   > ℹ️ If you get a 'Access denied' error, press 'Proceed to register for an account', continue with 'Proceed to registration'

3. Registering with Elixir Community (a European bioinformatics infrastructure)
4. Consenting for login information to be passed from 'SimpleVM Production'
5. Send your registration to the SPAAMSumScho202

If you have any issues, please contact James via email or the SPAAM slack!
