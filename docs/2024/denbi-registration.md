# Registration for deNBI Cloud

For the 2024 edition of the summer school, we will again be using cloud computing nodes kindly provided by the German [deNBI infrastructure](https://www.denbi.de/cloud).

For the use of the computing nodes you will need to sign up for the services.

A walkthrough from deNBI is available here: [https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/registration/](https://cloud.denbi.de/wiki/registration/), but you will need to star tthe process from the following registration link here <!-- [here](TO-UPDATE-SPAAMSumScho23)--> to start the process!

The process will take you through:

1. Selecting an identity provider of an existing account (e.g. institutional account, ORCiD, Google)

   > ℹ️ If your institution does not come up in the 'Login with' search box, we highly recommend instead using your [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) if you have one (and if not, get one!), as this is extremely useful for aggregating all of your academic output (and is used by _many_ academic services nowadays such as publishers).

2. Registering/linking account this with LifeSciencesRI (this is a centralised EU level single-sign-on service for EU biology related infrastructure)
3. Registering with the deNBI service itself
4. Consenting for login information to be passed from LifeSciencesRI with deNBI

Please be aware that there will be _multiple_ confirmation emails (likely three) sent to your email inbox and you will need to confirm them all! This is due to European data privacy laws.

If you have any issues, please contact James via email or the SPAAM slack!
