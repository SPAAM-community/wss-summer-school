🇩🇪 **Alex Hübner** is a computational biologist, who originally studied biotechnology, before switching to evolutionary biology during his PhD. For his postdoc in the Warinner lab, he focuses on investigating whether new methods in the field of modern metagenomics can be directly applied to ancient DNA data. Here, he is particularly interested in the _de novo_ assembly of ancient metagenomic sequencing data and the subsequent analysis of its results.

🇫🇷 **Arthur Kocher** initially trained as a veterinarian. He then pursued a PhD in the field of disease ecology, during which he studied the impact of biodiversity changes on the transmission of zoonotic diseases using molecular tools such as DNA metabarcoding. During his Post-Docs, he extended his research focus to evolutionary aspects of pathogens, which he currently investigates using ancient genomic data and Bayesian phylogenetics.

🇺🇸 **Betsy Nelson** _(background in preparation)_

🇩🇪 **Clemens Schmid** is a computational archaeologist pursuing a PhD in the group of Stephan Schiffels at the department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. He is trained both in archaeology and computer science and currently develops computational methods for the spatiotemporal co-analysis of archaeological and ancient genomic data. He worked in research projects on the European Neolithic, Copper and Bronze age and maintains research software in R, C++ and Haskell.

🇮🇹 **Giulia Zampirolo** is a postdoctoral researcher specialised in ancient metagenomics, with a background in both archaeology and paleogenomics. During her PhD at the Centre for GeoGenetics (University of Copenhagen), she utilised sedimentary ancient DNA across different types of deposits to investigate past human-environment interactions. Currently based at the Globe Institute, University of Copenhagen, she works in Kristine Bohmann’s research group, contributing to the project [SEACHANGE](https://seachange-erc.eu/research/wp1-researche), which explores the evolution of past marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Her research interests lie in the interdisciplinary intersection of archaeology, ancient DNA, and ecology to trace human-induced environmental changes over time.

🇩🇪 **Gunnar Neumann** (he/him) a geneticist with a background in biochemistry, archaeological sciences, and art history, is currently pursuing his Ph.D at the Max Planck Institute for evolutionary Anthropology. His primary research focus lies in the study of ancient pathogens and their evolution, particularly from the Bronze Age, and it includes work on Yersinia pestis, Salmonella enterica, and Brucella.

🇩🇪 **Jasmin Frangenberg** is a computational biologist, who originally studied Molecular Biology and Evolution. For her PhD in the Paleobiotechnology department at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology (HKI) in Jena, she characterizes antibiotic resistance in ancient microbial DNA and develops nf-core/funcscan, a best-practice analysis pipeline for the screening of nucleotide sequences for antimicrobial peptides, antibiotic resistance genes and biosynthetic gene clusters.

🇺🇸 **Keri Burge** is a second-year graduate student pursuing a PhD in the Department of Anthropology at Harvard University. She received a BA in Anthropology with a minor in Biological Sciences at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May of 2022. Now at Harvard, Keri is advised by Dr. Tina Warinner and is working with the Microbiome Sciences group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Her research interests include the evolution of the oral microbiome and prehistoric health.

🇳🇱 **Kevin Nota** has a PhD in molecular paleoecology from Uppsala University. Currently he is a postdoc in the Max Planck Research Group for Ancient Environmental Genomics. His main research interest is in population genomics from ancient environmental samples.

🇫🇷 **Maxime Borry** is a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. After an undergraduate in life sciences and a master in Ecology, followed by a master in bioinformatics, he graduated from the University of Jena with a PhD in bioinformatics, focused on ancient DNA metagenomics.

🇦🇹 **Meriam Guellil** is an expert in ancient microbial phylogenomics and metagenomics, particularly of human pathogens. She is particularly interested in the study of diseases that are invisible in the archaeological and osteological record, and the study of their evolution throughout human history. Her previous research includes studies on microbial species such as Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Borrelia recurrentis and Herpes simplex 1.

🇷🇺 **Nikolay Oskolkov** is a bioinformatician at Lund University and the bioinformatics platform of SciLifeLab, Sweden. He defended his PhD in theoretical physics in 2007, and switched to life sciences in 2012. His research interests include mathematical statistics and machine learning applied to genetics and genomics, single cell and ancient metagenomics data analysis.

🇫🇷 **Rémi Denise** is a postdoctoral researcher in bioinformatics at APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork. During his PhD he studied the evolution of the type IV filaments in Bacteria and Archaea using phylogenomics to understand how this family evolved in multiple different systems. He secured a MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship to study the viral diversity in the ancient metagenomes and how this viral population interacts with the environment and helps shape the microbial community.

🇬🇷 **Thiseas Lamnidis** (he/him) is a human population geneticist interested in European population history after the Bronze Age. To gain the required resolution to differentiate between Iron Age European populations, he is developing analytical methods based on the sharing of rare variation between individuals. He has also contributed to pipelines that streamline the processing and analysis of genetic data in a reproducible manner, while also facilitating dissemination of information among interdisciplinary colleagues.

🇩🇪 **Tessa Zeibig** is a trained Microbiologist, she’s currently pursuing her PhD in the Computational Pathogenomics Group led by Alexander Herbig at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Her focus is on human viruses, seeking to understand their evolution and development, using ancient genomic data.

🇨🇱 **Vilma Pérez** is a microbial ecologist at the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, University of Adelaide. Her research focuses on reconstructing microbial communities from present and past environments using environmental DNA techniques. Her objective is to use this information as bioindicators, providing insights into how environments have changed or responded to disturbances over time.
