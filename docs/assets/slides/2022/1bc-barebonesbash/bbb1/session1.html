What you see here is the "command prompt". username@server:pwd $

</p>

???
in Bash ALWAYS MIND THE `$`! Only copy after the `$` so you don't paste the command prompt too. `$` is also important when dealing with variables, which you saw a bit last time and will see more of today.

In this presentation we will use `$` at the start of a line of code to show where the command prompt would be.

We will use `>` to denote the subsequent lines of a multi-line code command.

---

# Absolute and Relative paths

In addition to your command prompt, you can use `pwd` to see your current directory
```bash
$ pwd
```

---

# Absolute and Relative paths

In addition to your command prompt, you can use `pwd` to see your current directory
```bash
$ pwd
```
```
/home/ubuntu
```

???
That's not what the command prompt shows! what is up here?

--

- `~` is a **relative** path, while `pwd` returns an **absolute** path

Happy to help, but I only use **absolute paths.**  
From Leipzig Hbf, take Querstraße southward.  
Continue straight and take Nürnberger Str. southward until you reach Str. des 18 Oktober.  
Finally take Str. des 18 Oktober. moving southeast until you reach EVA!
]

???
That is the equivalent of an absolute filepath.
It will ALWAYS take you to EVA, but you can only apply these directions if you start from Leipzig Hbf!

--
Examples of absolute paths:  
`/home/ubuntu`  
`/Hbf/Querstraße/Nürnberger_Str/Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/EVA`

---

# Let's talk about paths!

Not sure how to get back to Leipzig Hbf to apply those directions, you decide to ask someone else for directions.

  This street is Str. des 18 Oktober. Walk straight that way till you walk past the tram tracks and you will reach EVA!

  ]


???
These directions are equivalent to a relative path! They are easy to follow, but only work when you happen to be at the Bayerischer Bahnhof!

--
<br><br><br><br><br>
Examples of relative paths:  
`~`  
`./Str_18_Oktober/Deutscher_Platz/EVA`

---

# The different types of file paths

#### Absolute
- The location of a file or folder, __from the “root” directory__ (`/`).

#### Relative
- The location of a file or folder, __from your current directory.__

<br><br><br>
--
When writing code it is better to use **absolute** paths, so your code works independently of the users's current directory!

# Basic bash commands

- **List** directory contents:
```bash
$ ls
```
```
Desktop    Downloads    'MEGA X'    Pictures    Templates    bin

You should also see the current directory in your command prompt change!

---

# Basic bash commands

- **Download** a remote file to your computer
```bash
$ wget git.io/Boosted-BBB-meta
```
???
if you ls now you will see that a file called `Boosted-BBB-meta` has been downloaded.

--

- **Copy** a file or directory to a new location
```bash
$ cp Boosted-BBB-meta Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv
```
???
A copy of the file now exists with a slightly different name than the original

--

- **Remove** (delete) files
```bash
rm Boosted-BBB-meta
```

???
Only the copy exists now.

---

# Basic bash commands

# Datastreams,  
# Piping,  
# and redirects

???
Next we will talk about three linked concepts. 
Datastreams (the inputs and outputs of a script), 
Piping (bash's way to hook up multiple tools into a single command),
and Redirects (directing these data streams into files or the screen)

---

# Datastreams
Programs can take in and spit out data from different _streams_. By default there are 3 such data streams.

???
THISEAS  
Before we talk about redirects, you need to understand datastreams.

--
.left-column[

- `stdin`:  the __st__an__d__ard __in__put
- `stdout`: the __st__an__d__ard __out__put
- `stderr`: the __st__an__d__ard __err__or
]
???
stderr is what is usually printed on your screen, while stout is generally what ends up in output files, but it also goes to your screen by default.
--
.right.column[
<p align="center">
  <img src=".images/Datastreams.png" width="50%">
</p>]
???
In the background, each program also broadcasts an `exit code` which tells you if the program encountered errors. You will never see these in the wild, but it's good to know they exist.

---

# Piping

Piping lets you combine commands together using `|`
```bash
$ head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | wc -l
```
--
```
10
```

---

# Piping

Piping lets you combine commands together using `|`
```bash
$ head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | wc -l
```

<p>
  <img src=".images/Piping.png" width="100%">
</p>
<br>
<br>
The `stdout` of one script becomes the `stdin` of the other.
`stderr` is always printed on your screen.

---

# Redirects

Much like streams in the real world, datastreams can be redirected.

???
This way you can save the stdout of a program (or even the stderr) into a file to save for later.

--

- `stdin` can be redirected with `<`.

???
An arrow pointing TO your program name!

--

- `stdout` can be redirected with `>`.

???
An arrow pointing AWAY your program name!

--

- `stderr` can be redirected with `2>`.

???
Because it is the secondary output stream.
It is also possible to combine streams, but we won't get into that here.

--

```bash
$ head -n 10 Boosted-BBB-meta.tsv | wc -l >linecount.txt
$ cat linecount.txt
```
--
```
10
```

--

You can then __remove__ the file we just made
```bash
$ rm linecount.txt
```

---

# Finding the help you need

You don't always have to google for documentation! Many programs come with in-built helptext,
or access to online manuals right from your terminal!

--

- You can get a __one sentence summary__ of what a tool does with `whatis`
```bash
$ whatis cat
```
```
cat(1)                   - concatenate files and print on the standard output
```

--

<br>

- While `man` gives you __access to online manuals__ for each tool (exit with `q`)
```bash
$ man cat
```

--

> **Activity**: What flag should you give `cat` to include line numbers in the output?

# Variables

---

# Variables

A named container whose contents you can expand at will or change.

???
A variable is a container. You can place something in it and then access its contents by EXPANDING the variable.

--

You can assign variables with `=` and pull their contents with `$`

--

The easiest way to see the contents of a varable is using `echo`!
```bash
$ echo "This is my home directory: $HOME"
```
???
Called echo because the computer "literally prints out what you told it to"

HOME is a variable that points to your home directory, and is already set.
--
```
This is my home directory: /home/ubuntu
```

<p align="center"><i>And now for a trip...</i></p>

???
Now let's go on a summer trip and see how variables work in action!

---

# Variables

```bash
$ GreekFood=4            #Here, 'GreekFood' is a number.
$ echo "Greek food is $GreekFood people who want to know what heaven tastes like."
```

--

```
Greek food is 4 people who want to know what heaven tastes like.
```

--

```bash
$ GreekFood=delicious   #We overwrite that number with a word (i.e. a 'string').
$ echo "Everyone says that Greek food is $GreekFood."
```
--

```
Everyone says that Greek food is delicious.
```

--

```bash
$ GreekFood="Greek wine" #We can overwrite 'GreekFood' again, 
## but when there is a space in our string, we need quotations.
$ echo "The only thing better than Greek food is $GreekFood!"
```

--

```
The only thing better than Greek food is Greek wine!
```

--

```bash
$ GreekFood=7 #And, of course, we can overwrite with a number again too.
$ echo "I have been to Greece $GreekFood times already this year, for the food and wine!"
```

--

```
I have been to Greece 7 times already this year, for the food and wine!
```

---

# Quotes matter!

In bash, there is a big difference between a single quote `'` and a double quote `"`!

 - The contents of single quotes, are passed on as they are.
 - Inside double quotes, contents are _interpreted_!

???
That means that it will be read just like the rest of the code.

--

.left-column-66[
In some cases the difference doesn't matter:
```bash
$ echo "I like Greek Food"
$ echo 'I like Greek Food'
```
```
I like Greek Food
I like Greek Food
```
]

--

.left-column-66[
In other cases it makes all the difference:
```bash
$ Arr=Banana
$ echo 'Pirates say $Arr'
$ echo "Minions say $Arr"
```
]

???
You can already see from the syntax highlighting that $Arr is treated differently in the two quotes.

# Parameter expansion

---

# The basics

Here's an example variable:
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
```
???
The absolute file path to some imaginary file.

--

.left-column[

To expand a variable use `${}`.
```bash
$ echo ${foo}
```
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
```
]

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/giphy.gif" title="Source: https://giphy.com/gifs/adweek-color-apple-8YpifFDs9Ux1VNQP1S/links" width="75%">
</p>
]

???
This is actually what bash did behind-the-scenes when we typed `$Var` thus far.
It is a good idea to put all variables in `{}` so there is never any confusion as to which is the variable name.

--

You can also add a **parameter** to expansions:
```bash
$ echo ${foo#/home/}
$ echo ${foo#*/}
```
```
thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt

```
???
The first command strips the text after the # from the START of the variable.

You can also use wildcards to make more general expansions.

---

# Some parameters for expansion

```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}    # No parameters in this expansion
$ echo ${foo#*/} # Removes everything before the first '/'
$ echo ${foo%.*} # What will this do?
```
--
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
 home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae
```

Bash will look for the provided pattern ONCE and remove it.

There are more `.` and `/` but they are not removed.
--

These expansion can be generalised:
```bash
$ echo ${foo##*/} # Removes everything before any '/'
$ echo ${foo%%.*} # Removes everything after any '.'
```
--
```
BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB
```
???
When the parameter is given twice, bash will keep searching for the pattern until it can no longer find it.

---
# More parameters for expansion

You can use two `/` to substitute parts of the variable:
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}                    # No parameters
$ echo ${foo/BBB/BareBonesBash}  # Change BBB to BareBonesBash
```
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BareBonesBash.is.bae.txt
```

---

# More parameters for expansion

You can use two `/` to substitute parts of the variable:
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${foo}                    # No parameters
$ echo ${foo/BBB/BareBonesBash}  # Change BBB to BareBonesBash
```
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BareBonesBash.is.bae.txt
```

Leaving the second `/` out replaces the pattern with "an empty string".
```bash
$ echo ${foo/BBB}  # Remove BBB
```
???
That is programmer speak for "nothing". i.e. it removes the pattern.
--
```
/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/.is.bae.txt
```

---
# The last parameter, I swear!

Finally, you can check the length of a variable by using a `#` BEFORE the variable name.
```bash
$ foo="/home/thiseas/folder/subfolder/BBB.is.bae.txt"
$ echo ${#foo}  # The length of the variable contents
```
--
```
45
```
So the filepath in `foo` is 45 characters long!

This parameter is more useful when dealing with **bash arrays** (i.e. lists of things).

We will not be talking about bash arrays further, but they are basically indexed/numbered lists of stuff.

That means you can, for example, ask for the 5th item in a bash array and get only that one. Look em up if that sounds useful to you! **[Rule 2]**

But before that, let's briefly give a few pointers on how to google for help with bash and programming languages in general.

# Knowing the question

* ALWAYS include the name of the language in your query.

It can make a HUGE difference! Also, you probably don't want to learn how to do it in a different language (yet).

# Knowing the question

* ALWAYS include the name of the language in your query.

* Broaden your question.

# Knowing the question

* ALWAYS include the name of the language in your query.

* Broaden your question.

* When you are more familiar, use fancy programmer lingo to make google think you know what you are talking about.

__All the cool hackers say:__
  - "_string_" and not "_text_".
  - "_float_" and not "_decimal_".
  - Some of these terms can be language specific.
