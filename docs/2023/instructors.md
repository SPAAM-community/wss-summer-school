ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ **James Fellows Yates** is an archaeology-trained biomolecular archaeologist and convert to palaeogenomics, and is recently pivoting to bioinformatics. He specialises in ancient metagenomics analysis, generating tools and high-throughput approaches and high-quality pipelines for validating and analysing ancient (oral) microbiomes and palaeogenomic data.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ **Christina Warinner** is Group Leader of Microbiome Sciences at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and Associate Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University. She serves on the Leadership Team of the Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for the Archaeoscience of the Ancient Mediterranean (MHAAM), and is a Professor in the Faculty of Biological Sciences at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her research focuses on the use of metagenomics and paleoproteomics to better understand past human diet, health, and the evolution of the human microbiome.

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **Aida Andrades ValtueÃ±a** is a geneticist interested in pathogen evolution, with particular interest in prehistoric pathogens. She has been exploring new methods to analyse ancient pathogen data to understand their past function and ecology to inform models of pathogen emergence.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Alexander Herbig** is a bioinformatician and group leader for Computational Pathogenomics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. His main interest is in studying the evolution of human pathogens and in methods development for pathogen detection and bacterial genomics.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Alina Hiss** is a PhD student in the Computational Pathogenomics group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. She is interested in the evolution of human pathogens and working on material from the Carpathian basin to gain insights about the presence and spread of pathogens in the region during the Early Medieval period.

ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **Arthur Kocher** initially trained as a veterinarian. He then pursued a PhD in the field of disease ecology, during which he studied the impact of biodiversity changes on the transmission of zoonotic diseases using molecular tools such as DNA metabarcoding. During his Post-Docs, he extended his research focus to evolutionary aspects of pathogens, which he currently investigates using ancient genomic data and Bayesian phylogenetics.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Clemens Schmid** is a computational archaeologist pursuing a PhD in the group of Stephan Schiffels at the department of Archaeogenetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. He is trained both in archaeology and computer science and currently develops computational methods for the spatiotemporal co-analysis of archaeological and ancient genomic data. He worked in research projects on the European Neolithic, Copper and Bronze age and maintains research software in R, C++ and Haskell.

ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± **Kevin Nota** has a PhD in molecular paleoecology from Uppsala University. Currently he is a postdoc in the Max Planck Research Group for Ancient Environmental Genomics. His main research interest is in population genomics from ancient environmental samples.

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ **Meriam Guellil** is an expert in ancient microbial phylogenomics and metagenomics, particularly of human pathogens. She is particularly interested in the study of diseases that are invisible in the archaeological and osteological record, and the study of their evolution throughout human history. Her previous research includes studies on microbial species such as Yersinia pestis, Haemophilus influenzae, Borrelia recurrentis and Herpes simplex 1. 

ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º **Nikolay Oskolkov** is a bioinformatician at Lund University and the bioinformatics platform of SciLifeLab, Sweden. He defended his PhD in theoretical physics in 2007, and switched to life sciences in 2012. His research interests include mathematical statistics and machine learning applied to genetics and genomics, single cell and ancient metagenomics data analysis.

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Robin Warner**  is a MSc bioinformatics student at the Leipzig University. He is currently writing his master's thesis in the Max Planck Research Group for Ancient Environmental Genomics about the comparison of ancient sedimentary DNA capture methods and shotgun sequencing.

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· **Thiseas Lamnidis** is a human population geneticist interested in European population history after the Bronze Age. To gain the required resolution to differentiate between Iron Age European populations, he is developing analytical methods based on the sharing of rare variation between individuals. He has also contributed to pipelines that streamline the processing and analysis of genetic data in a reproducible manner, while also facilitating dissemination of information among interdisciplinary colleagues.
