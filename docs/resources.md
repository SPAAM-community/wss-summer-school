- [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/)
  - European Nucleotide Archive, the major public European sequencing data
    archive. Mirrors the American NCBI SRA, and Japanese DDBJ databases.
  - The vast majority of academic sequencing data is archived here
- [AncientMetagenomeDir](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir/)
  - Community-curated repository containing standardised metadata and links to
    data for all publicly available ancient metagenomic data. Maintained by
    SPAAM.
